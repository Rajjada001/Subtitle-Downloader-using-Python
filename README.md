# Subtitle-Downloader-using-Python

<p>
  Sometimes we wonder it is a hard process to go through web and download a particular movie subtitle and extract it. Wherefore, I have created this file and if you run this file. It will ask a movie name as input, it will give the options that are available on the web. Choose the option then the subtitle is directly downloaded to your system. <h3> Good Luck. üëç</h3> 
</p>

## Requirements
Install pip  in python folder
<ul>
  <li> <a href = "https://pypi.org/project/html5lib/">Install HTML5LIB </a> </li>
